## Live Tracker
An IOS application developed for the SFUCycling Club to coordinate route location. The application will display fetched scheduled routes by querying a MySQL database that stores route metadata in a GEOJson and information including total_distance, elevation_gain, duration, and ride date.

Once the tracker has been started, location data will be continuously collected using the Core Location and Core Data frameworks. These data points will be sent to a server that will store and be displayed on the [SFUCycling](https://www.sfucycling.ca/) website. Additionally, markers can be placed with a custom message and geolocation, which will be reflected on the app and website.
